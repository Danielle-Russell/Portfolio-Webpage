       <h2> Hello, my name is Danielle Russell.</h2>
      <p>I am a Web Developer based in Oxnard, California. I was born in Victoria, Australia and, as a prospective Computer Science student, I have always enjoyed the creative side of developing. I am well versed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming, and want to continue to build on these skills by creating websites that are functional, well-structured and captivating.   </p>

        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p> I enjoy working with other like-minded developers, and constantly learning and improving my skills. I have always been passionate about computer programming, as I love building things from scratch and seeing them come to life. I also love a good challenge and a chance to utilize my problem solving skills.</p>
        <p> When I am not developing, I am spending time with my family. We enjoy hiking and exploring the mountains, as well as frequenting the beach. Living in Southern California, we are lucky to have these sceneries at our doorstep!</p>
        <p> My services currently include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> HTML </li>
            <li> CSS </li>
            <li> JavaScript Programming </li>
